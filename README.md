## **AMI BIOS Guard Extractor**

![]()

#### **Description**

Parses AMI BIOS Guard (a.k.a. PFAT, Platform Firmware Armoring Technology) images, extracts their SPI/BIOS/UEFI firmware components and decompiles the Intel BIOS Guard Scripts. It supports all AMI PFAT revisions and formats, including those with Index Information tables or nested AMI PFAT structures. The output comprises only final firmware components which are directly usable by end users.

Note that the AMI PFAT structure may not have an explicit component order. AMI's BIOS Guard Firmware Update Tool (AFUBGT) updates components based on the user/OEM provided Parameters and Options or Index Information table, when applicable. That means that merging all the components together does not usually yield a proper SPI/BIOS/UEFI image. The utility does generate such a merged file with the name "00 -- \<filename\>\_ALL.bin" but it is up to the end user to determine its usefulness. Moreover, any custom OEM data after the AMI PFAT structure are additionally stored in the last file with the name "\<n+1\> -- \_OOB.bin" and it is once again up to the end user to determine its usefulness. In cases where the trailing custom OEM data include a nested AMI PFAT structure, the utility will process and extract it automatically as well.

#### **Usage**

You can either Drag & Drop or manually enter AMI BIOS Guard (PFAT) image file(s). Optional arguments:
  
* -h or --help : show help message and exit
* -v or --version : show utility name and version
* -i or --input-dir : extract from given input directory
* -o or --output-dir : extract in given output directory
* -e or --auto-exit : skip all user action prompts

#### **Compatibility**

Should work at all Windows, Linux or macOS operating systems which have Python 3.10 support.

#### **Prerequisites**

Optionally, to decompile the AMI PFAT \> Intel BIOS Guard Scripts, you must have the following 3rd party utility at the "external" project directory:

* [BIOS Guard Script Tool](https://github.com/platomav/BGScriptTool) (i.e. big_script_tool.py)
